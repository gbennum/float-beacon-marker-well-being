This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).  
Additonally, a full stack with PostgreSQL, Sequelize, and Express was added using [Create React App Fullstack](https://github.com/ekatzenstein/create-react-app-fullstack).  


## Running

In the project directory, run:

### `npm install`

Assuming you have some sort of postgreSQL server installed: 
### `createdb float-beacon-marker-well-being`

If you don't, hopefully you're managing packages with homebrew:
### `brew install postgresql`

If you're not, this may be unpleasant- you might consider just installing homebrew:
[https://postgresapp.com/documentation/cli-tools.html](https://postgresapp.com/documentation/cli-tools.html)

Finally, 
### `npm seed`
### `npm start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.


## Other Commands

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
The app is ready to be deployed!
